title: Installing and Configuring DX APM for Pivotal Platform
---

##Before You Start
1. Create a [Pivotal Network] (https://network.pivotal.io/) account if you do not have one.

1. [Redis for Pivotal Platform] (https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis) with Lua scripting enabled is a requirement for using DX APM for Pivotal Platform. If you have it installed already, check if Lua scripting is enabled. If not, enable it in the Ops Manager and re-install the Redis tile. Lua scripting can be enabled in the **Shared-VM-Plan** and **On-Demand-Plans** configuration sections within the tile. You can install or re-install Redis alongside DX APM for Pivotal Platform.


##Install the Tile

1. If you have not already done so, download the **DX Application Performance Management for Pivotal Platform** tile package from [Pivotal Network] (https://network.pivotal.io/).

1.  In Ops Manager, on the Installation Dashboard click **Import a Product** and upload the **DX Application Performance Management for Pivotal Platform** tile package that you previously downloaded.
A new unused product entry for **DX Application Performance Management for Pivotal Platform** displays.

1. Click **+** next to **DX Application Performance Management for Pivotal Platform** under the unused products section.

1. Click the newly added **DX Application Performance Management for Pivotal Platform** tile.

1. Assign the tile to the same network to which you have assigned other services.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes** or **Install** depending on your Pivotal Platform version.

1. Click **Apply**. DX APM for Pivotal Platform will now install (If you chose to install Redis for Pivotal Platform alongside, it will install first).


##Validate the Installation

On successful installation, validate the install by running the ``cf marketplace -s introscope`` command. You should see a plan listing for **introscope**.

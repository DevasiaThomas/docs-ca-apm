title: Installing and Configuring DX APM for PCF
---

##Before You Start
1. Create a [Pivotal Network] (https://network.pivotal.io/) account if you do not have one.

1. [Redis for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)] (https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-redis) with Lua scripting enabled is a prerequisite for using DX APM for PCF. If you have it installed already, please check if Lua scripting is enabled. If not, please enable it in the Ops Manager and re-install the Redis tile. Lua scripting can be enabled in the **Shared-VM-Plan** and **On-Demand-Plans** configuration sections within the tile. You may install or re-install Redis alongside DX APM for PCF.


##Install the Tile

1. If you have not already done so, download the **DX Application Performance Management for PCF** tile package from [Pivotal Network] (https://network.pivotal.io/).

1.  In Ops Manager, on the Installation Dashboard click **Import a Product** and upload the **DX Application Performance Management for PCF** tile package that you previously downloaded.  
A new unused product entry for **DX Application Performance Management for PCF** displays.

1. Click **+** next to **DX Application Performance Management for PCF** under the unused products section. 

1. Click the newly added **DX Application Performance Management for PCF** tile.  

1. Assign the tile to the same network to which you have assigned other services.  

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes** or **Install** depending on your PCF version.

1. Click **Apply**. DX APM for PCF will now install (If you chose to install Redis for PCF alongside, it will install first).


##Validate the Installation

On successful installation, validate the install by running the ``cf marketplace -s introscope`` command. You should see a plan listing for **introscope**.
